A simple raster drawing program I wrote in 2024, using SDL2. Partially based off Flipnote Studio.
It has:
- A limited color palette
- Animation features
- 2 drawing layers
- Modifiable brush sizes
- Erasing
- Canvas clearing

Requires SDL2 libraries to build.

Controls:
- ``[/]``: Decrease/Increase brush size
- ``Middle mouse drag``: Pan canvas
- ``Scroll wheel/,/.``: Zoom canvas
- ``C``: Clear layer
- ``Left/Right arrows``: Switch frames/Create new frame
- ``Enter``: Play animation
- ``B``: Switch layers
